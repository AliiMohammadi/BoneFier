# BoneFier
A hidden project for trolling some shows. 
Application will make a copy of it self to the windows document
folder. 
In the right time it will activate trolls.
In this repository, There's a remote file which can 
control the date and other things whenever developers want.
I used this app to troll one of my professors at university anonymously.
